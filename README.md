# Cardiac-Output-Estimation

This repository is associated with the manuscript "Revisiting cardiac output estimated noninvasively from oxygen uptake during exercise: An exploratory hypothesis generating replication study".

REPOSITORY CONTENT:
- The R file which holds the entire analysis code called "Analyses_Code"

- The original data on which this replication study is based:
a) "Data_Stringer_AJP_1997" from Stringer, W. W., Hansen, J. E., & Wasserman, K. (1997). Cardiac output estimated noninvasively from oxygen uptake during exercise. Journal of Applied Physiology, 82(3), 908-912. https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1997.82.3.908

b) "Data_Astrand_AJP_1964" from Ã…strand, P. O., Cuddy, T. E., Saltin, B., & Stenberg, J. (1964). Cardiac output during submaximal and maximal work. Journal of Applied Physiology, 19(2), 268-274. https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1964.19.2.268

- Three PDF files of the Figures presented in assocaited manuscript. These will be created when running the R code.

DEPENDENCIES: The R code requires that the following libraries are installed: ggplot2, ggpubr, rootSolve, cowplot
